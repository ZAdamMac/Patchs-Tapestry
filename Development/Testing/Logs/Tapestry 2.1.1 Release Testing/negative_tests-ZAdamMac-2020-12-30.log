================================BEGIN TESTING==================================
----------------------------[Negative Unit Tests]-----------------------------

This log is for a test of a development version of Tapestry, with SHA256 hash:

60031e24f91be93b8187a331eb0a7cc1d9c7de701e9358d41ae6420ecc494c0c


Which relies on the classes library with hash:

6aeebc09c17f575e60a1809bbfde615acbb58ea1d573287d7f362614e1b0c457

------------------[Block Placement Test: Invalid-Sized File]------------------
This test validates that a tapestry.Block object will not accept a put()
request for a file that is larger than the remaining size of the block.


[PASS] The Block object indicated it rejected the file.


------------------[Block Signature Validation Test]------------------
This test validates that tapestry will reject a file with invalid signatures


[PASS] The verify_blocks correctly ignored the invalidly-signed file.


------------------[Recovery Index Confusion Test]------------------
Makes sure that RecoveryIndexError is raised correctly when loading a
tapestry.RecoveryIndex option with data.


[PASS] Intercepted the expected exception.


------------------[Task_Decompress Test: Uncompressed Target]------------------
This test validates that the expected response is returned by TaskDecompress
when it is called against a target file that does not contain BZ2 compressed
data.


[PASS] The file was correctly skipped.


----------------------------[Integrity Check Test]-----------------------------
Feeds a garbage hash to TaskCheckIntegrity to ensure that files are correctly
rejected by this test when necessary.


[PASS] The hashing mismatch was correctly detected


-------------------------[SFTP Connection Trust Test]---------------------------
Calls sftp_connect against a known-good SFTP server using an invalid trust, and
ensures a valid response came back.


[PASS] sftp_connect refused to connect to an untrusted server.


-----------------------[SFTP Connection Failure Test]--------------------------
Calls sftp_connect against a non-extant SFTP server and ensures the expected
responses come back


[PASS] sftp_connect behaves correctly when the target server is down.


---------------------------[SFTP File Listing Test]----------------------------
Calls sftp_find to obtain a listing of all files in the target directory on the
SFTP without adequate permissions.


[PASS] sftp_find behaves as expected when write permissions are missing.


----------------------------[SFTP Placement Test]------------------------------
Attempts to place a file onto an SFTP server without permissions and observes
results.


[PASS] sftp_place behaves as expected when write permissions are absent.


--------------------------[SFTP File Retrieval Test]---------------------------
Attempts to fetch a known-to-exist file from the SFTP share without appropriate
permission.


[PASS] sftp_fetch behaves as expected on encountering an error.
